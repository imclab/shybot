How can a robot build a relationship with its _friends_? Can a robot think based on its relationship with human? Can a robot learn in an irreversible manner?\r\nShybot is here to explore these questions.\r\nShybot is an emotion-driven robot like a shy creature which recognizes friends or strangers and \r\ninteracts with them differently. We envision the Shybot project can be further developed into the \"CPU\" for emotion robotics. According to Asimov's foundamental assumptions for robots, we believe the robotics design has to be intricically coupled with human-machine interaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Asimov's Three Laws (1942)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics)\r\n  1. __A robot may not injure a human being__ or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\r\n  2. __A robot must obey the orders__ given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\r\n  3. __A robot must protect its own existence__ as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShybot was initiated as a \r\n[research project](http://affect.media.mit.edu/projects.php?id=2306 \"Affective Computing Group\") \r\nfrom the Autism Theory and Technology class \r\n(co-taught by [Rosalind Picard](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24652902?SThisFB), \r\n[Cynthia Breazeal](http://www.ted.com/talks/cynthia_breazeal_the_rise_of_personal_robots.html), and \r\n[Sherry Turkle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikn-_myAfhQ)) at MIT Media Lab in [2007](https://github.com/jackylee0424/shybot/blob/master/doc/shybot_07short.m4v?raw=true). \r\nMany of Shybot's features are inspired by [_The Uncanny_](https://github.com/jackylee0424/shybot/wiki/Uncanny) by Sigmund Freud (1919) and [_Computing Machinery and Intelligence_](https://github.com/jackylee0424/shybot/blob/master/doc/turing.pdf?raw=true) by A. Turing (1950).\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.github.com/jackylee0424/shybot/master/doc/shybot_07a.jpg\" height=160 />\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.github.com/jackylee0424/shybot/master/doc/shybot_07b.jpg\" height=160 />\r\n<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Kou-Kou_by_Georgios_Iakovidis.jpg/200px-Kou-Kou_by_Georgios_Iakovidis.jpg\" height=160 />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoadmap\r\n======\r\n\r\n- _Peer-to-peer face learning_. It would be more efficient to accumulate the \"learning\" part so that this network of Shybots could keep improving themselves.\r\n- _Companion_. The plan is to re-build it using some existing platform \r\n(e.g., [Romo](http://romotive.com/ \"iPhone/iPod extension toy car\"), [SparkFun robotic car](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10825), or [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) with camera, sensors, and motors). \r\nThis repository contains Shybot's work-in-progress prototype code based on Romo. For making it work as a consumer toy, \r\nwe'll need durable design and robust sensors for basic safety concerns. \r\nAdding human detector (and danger detector) using non-contact temperature sensors \r\n([MLX90614](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9570) \r\nor [MLX90620](http://www.melexis.com/Infrared-Thermometer-Sensors/Infrared-Thermometer-Sensors/MLX90620-776.aspx)). __This part was paused because it's also too much fun to build its physical part. We'd like to focus on the software now__.\r\n\r\n\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.github.com/jackylee0424/shybot/master/doc/shybot_v1.png\" height=160 />\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.github.com/jackylee0424/shybot/master/doc/shybot_13a.png\" height=160 />\r\n\r\n\r\nCitation\r\n======\r\n\r\nLee, C.H., Kim, K., Breazeal, C., Picard, R.W.
