This repository contains \r\nits prototype code based on Romo. Shybot was a [research project](http://affect.media.mit.edu/projects.php?id=2306 \"Affective Computing Group\") from the Autism \r\nTheory and Technology class (2007) at the Media Lab, MIT. \r\n\r\nMy plan is to rebuild it using some existing platform (e.g., [Romo](http://romotive.com/ \"iPhone/iPod extension toy car\") or sparkfun \r\nrobotic car). The key is to implement its emotion-familiarity model using face \r\nrecognition techniques.\r\n\r\nCitation\r\n======\r\n    Lee, C.H., Kim, K., Breazeal, C., Picard, R.W.
