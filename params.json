How can a robot build a relationship with its _friends_? \r\nShybot is here to explore these questions.\r\nShybot is an emotion-driven robot like a shy creature which recognizes friends or strangers and \r\ninteracts with them differently. Shybot was a \r\n[research project](http://affect.media.mit.edu/projects.php?id=2306 \"Affective Computing Group\") \r\noriginated from the Autism Theory and Technology class \r\n(co-taught by [Rosalind Picard](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24652902?SThisFB), \r\n[Cynthia Breazeal](http://www.ted.com/talks/cynthia_breazeal_the_rise_of_personal_robots.html), and \r\n[Sherry Turkle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikn-_myAfhQ)) at MIT Media Lab in 2007. \r\n\r\n[Short video from '07 (.m4v)](https://github.com/jackylee0424/shybot/blob/master/doc/shybot_07short.m4v?raw=true)\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.github.com/jackylee0424/shybot/master/doc/shybot_07a.jpg\" height=240 />\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.github.com/jackylee0424/shybot/master/doc/shybot_07b.jpg\" height=240 />\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent Development\r\n======\r\nThe plan is to re-build it using some existing platform (e.g., [Romo](http://romotive.com/ \"iPhone/iPod extension toy car\")\r\nor [SparkFun robotic car](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10825)). \r\nThe key is to implement its emotion-familiarity model using face recognition techniques on iPod touch 4th(!). \r\nThis repository contains Shybot's work-in-progress prototype code based on Romo. Proximity sensors and industrial design will be added soon.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.github.com/jackylee0424/shybot/master/doc/shybot_13a.png\" height=200 />\r\n<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Kou-Kou_by_Georgios_Iakovidis.jpg/200px-Kou-Kou_by_Georgios_Iakovidis.jpg\" height=200 />\r\n\r\n\r\nCitation\r\n======\r\nLee, C.H., Kim, K., Breazeal, C., Picard, R.W.
