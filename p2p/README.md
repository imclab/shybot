Shybot Machine Network
======
For emotion robots, there won't be stand-alone or single machine robot software. Machines will be interacting closely with human and their enviornments. This is a peer-to-peer infrastructure for Shybots to share data. This experiment starts from deploying face recognition (using standard PCA approach) mechanism to each Shybot entity (currently a software node). Each node is able to enroll human faces as training dataset and automonously broadcast to all peers.




Setup
======
1. install dependencies: cv2, sklearn, tornado
2. change config_.py to config.py
3. $ python main.py
