Shybot
======

Shybot is an emotion-driven robot like a shy creature. This repository contains 
its prototype code based on Romo. Shybot was a research project from the Autism 
Theory and Technology class (2007) at the Media Lab, MIT.

My plan is to rebuild it using some existing platform (e.g., Romo or sparkfun 
robotic car). The key is to implement its emotion-familiarity model using face 
recognition techniques.

Notes
======
    To smoothly run it in debug mode, iPhone/iPod needs to be docked (on Romo) 
    "before" connecting the charging wire to your Mac.
