Can a robot "like" a person? How can a robot build a relationship with its "friends"? 
Shybot is here to explore these questions.
Shybot is an emotion-driven robot like a shy creature which recognizes friends or strangers and 
interacts with them differently. Shybot was a 
[research project](http://affect.media.mit.edu/projects.php?id=2306 "Affective Computing Group") 
originated from the Autism Theory and Technology class 
(co-taught by [Rosalind Picard](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24652902?SThisFB), 
[Cynthia Breazeal](http://www.ted.com/talks/cynthia_breazeal_the_rise_of_personal_robots.html), and 
[Sherry Turkle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikn-_myAfhQ)) at MIT Media Lab in 2007.

Current Development
======
The plan is to re-build it using some existing platform (e.g., [Romo](http://romotive.com/ "iPhone/iPod extension toy car")
or [SparkFun robotic car](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10825)). 
The key is to implement its emotion-familiarity model using face recognition techniques on iPod touch 4th(!). 
This repository contains Shybot's work-in-progress prototype code based on Romo. Proximity sensors and industrial design will be added soon.

Notes
======
- All codes are under MIT license.
- For Romo developers, to smoothly run it in debug mode, iPhone/iPod needs to be docked (on Romo) "before" connecting the charging wire to your Mac. "After" connected, Romo will try connecting its app, so click "ignore" then open Shybot app.
