Shybot
======

Shybot is an emotion-driven robot like a shy creature. This repository contains 
its prototype code based on Romo. Shybot was a [research project](http://affect.media.mit.edu/projects.php?id=2306 "Affective Computing Group") from the Autism 
Theory and Technology class (2007) at the Media Lab, MIT.

My plan is to rebuild it using some existing platform (e.g., [Romo](http://romotive.com/ "iPhone/iPod extension toy car") or sparkfun 
robotic car). The key is to implement its emotion-familiarity model using face 
recognition techniques.

Notes
======
To smoothly run it in debug mode, iPhone/iPod needs to be docked (on Romo) "before" connecting the charging wire to your Mac. "After" connected, Romo will try connecting its app, so click "ignore" then open Shybot app.
