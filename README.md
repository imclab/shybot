Shybot
======

Shybot is an emotion-driven robot like a shy creature. Shybot was a [research project](http://affect.media.mit.edu/projects.php?id=2306 "Affective Computing Group") from the Autism 
Theory and Technology class (2007) at the Media Lab, MIT. [Short video from '07 (.m4v)](https://github.com/jackylee0424/shybot/blob/master/doc/shybot_07short.m4v?raw=true)

Current Development
======
The plan is to re-build it using some existing platform (e.g., [Romo](http://romotive.com/ "iPhone/iPod extension toy car") or sparkfun 
robotic car). The key is to implement its emotion-familiarity model using face recognition techniques on iPod touch 4th(!). This repository contains Shybot's work-in-progress prototype code based on Romo.

Notes
======
- All codes are under MIT license.
- For Romo developers, to smoothly run it in debug mode, iPhone/iPod needs to be docked (on Romo) "before" connecting the charging wire to your Mac. "After" connected, Romo will try connecting its app, so click "ignore" then open Shybot app.
